The app is built using the React JavaScript library, which provides a powerful framework for building responsive and dynamic user interfaces.

The app is designed to be easy to use and navigate, with a clean and intuitive interface. Users can create multiple budgets, each with its own set of categories and spending limits. They can add expenses and income to each budget, with the app automatically tracking their spending and providing insights into their financial health related to the project.
